✅ 1. What are HTTP methods?

Answer:
HTTP methods are verbs that tell the server what action to perform on a resource such as CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE.
Example methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT.


---

✅ 2. Explain CRUD operations with HTTP methods.

Answer:

Create → POST

Read → GET

Update → PUT (full) / PATCH (partial)

Delete → DELETE



---

✅ 3. Difference between POST, PUT, and PATCH.

Answer:

POST → create new resource (ID generated by server).

PUT → replace entire existing resource (client sends full body).

PATCH → update only specific fields (partial update).


Example:

POST /users

PUT /users/10

PATCH /users/10



---

✅ 4. What is idempotency?

Answer:
A method is idempotent if calling it multiple times gives the same result.

Method	Idempotent?

GET	Yes
PUT	Yes
DELETE	Yes
POST	No
PATCH	Partially



---

✅ 5. Why is POST not idempotent?

Answer:
Because calling POST multiple times creates multiple new resources.


---

✅ 6. What is SAFE vs UNSAFE HTTP method?

Answer:

Safe → does not change server state

GET

HEAD

OPTIONS

TRACE


Unsafe → modifies data

POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE




---

✅ 7. Explain GET vs HEAD.

GET → returns headers + body
HEAD → returns headers only (no body)

Used to check:

file size

last modified

content type



---

✅ 8. What is OPTIONS method?

Answer:
OPTIONS is used to list what methods are allowed on a resource.

Response example:

Allow: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Also used by browsers for CORS pre-flight.


---

✅ 9. What is TRACE? Why is it disabled?

Answer:
TRACE echoes back the request received by the server → used for debugging.
It is disabled in most servers because it can be used for cross-site tracing attacks.


---

✅ 10. What is CONNECT method?

Answer:
CONNECT is used to establish a tunnel, mainly for HTTPS through a proxy.

Example:

CONNECT www.google.com:443


---

✅ 11. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?

PUT → full update (replace entire object)
PATCH → partial update (modify specific fields)

If the client sends:

{ "name": "John" }

PUT → other fields become null/empty

PATCH → only name is updated



---

✅ 12. Is DELETE idempotent?

Answer:
Yes, because deleting the same resource again has no further effect.


---

✅ 13. What is RESTful mapping of HTTP methods?

Collection URL (/users)

GET → list users

POST → create user


Single resource (/users/10)

GET → get user

PUT → replace user

PATCH → modify user

DELETE → remove user



---

1. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?

HTTP → Unencrypted
HTTPS → Encrypted using SSL/TLS (secure, prevents MITM attacks)


---

2. What is REST?

REST is an architectural style that uses:

Stateless communication

HTTP methods

Resource-based URLs

JSON/XML representations

Cacheable responses



---

3. What is a REST Resource?

Anything that can be identified by a URI. Example:
/users/10 → user resource
/products/5/reviews → review resource


---

4. What is HATEOAS?

Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State
API response contains links to navigate further.

Example:

{
  "id": 10,
  "name": "Upender",
  "_links": {
    "self": "/users/10",
    "orders": "/users/10/orders"
  }
}


---

5. Explain statelessness in REST.

Server does NOT store client session.
Each request contains everything needed.


---

6. How do you make APIs scalable?

Caching (Redis)

Load balancing

Pagination

Async processing (Kafka/Queues)

Database indexing

Microservices



---

7. Difference: Authentication vs Authorization.

Authentication → "Who are you?"
Authorization → "What can you access?"


---

8. What is CORS?

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
Used when frontend & backend run on different domains.


---

9. Why do browsers send OPTIONS request?

For CORS preflight.
To check allowed methods: GET, POST, PUT, etc.


---

10. When should we use PUT vs PATCH?

PUT → full update
PATCH → partial update


---

11. What is an Idempotent method?

Calling the method multiple times yields the same result.
Examples: GET, PUT, DELETE.


---

12. Why POST is not idempotent?

Multiple POST calls create multiple records.


---

13. What is rate limiting?

Control how many requests a client can send.
Protects server from abuse.


---

14. What is difference between 200, 201, 204 status codes?

200 → Success + body
201 → Created (new resource created)
204 → Success but no body


---

15. What is Content Negotiation?

Client selects format:
Accept: application/json
Server chooses response format based on header.


---

16. Why should URIs not contain verbs?

URIs represent resources, not actions.
Use:

/users

/users/10


Not:

/getUsers

/createUser



---

17. What are idempotent & safe methods?

Safe → GET, HEAD, OPTIONS
Idempotent → GET, PUT, DELETE


---

18. Difference between Query Params and Path Params

Path params → resource identity
/users/10

Query params → filter / sort / pagination
/users?page=2&limit=10


---

19. What is API versioning?

Maintains backward compatibility.
Example:
/api/v1/users
/api/v2/users


---

20. What is ETag?

Used for caching.
Server sends a unique hash:
ETag: "ab32ef"
Browser uses it to check if resource changed.
