✅ 1. What are HTTP methods?

Answer:
HTTP methods are verbs that tell the server what action to perform on a resource such as CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE.
Example methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE, CONNECT.


---

✅ 2. Explain CRUD operations with HTTP methods.

Answer:

Create → POST

Read → GET

Update → PUT (full) / PATCH (partial)

Delete → DELETE



---

✅ 3. Difference between POST, PUT, and PATCH.

Answer:

POST → create new resource (ID generated by server).

PUT → replace entire existing resource (client sends full body).

PATCH → update only specific fields (partial update).


Example:

POST /users

PUT /users/10

PATCH /users/10



---

✅ 4. What is idempotency?

Answer:
A method is idempotent if calling it multiple times gives the same result.

Method	Idempotent?

GET	Yes
PUT	Yes
DELETE	Yes
POST	No
PATCH	Partially



---

✅ 5. Why is POST not idempotent?

Answer:
Because calling POST multiple times creates multiple new resources.


---

✅ 6. What is SAFE vs UNSAFE HTTP method?

Answer:

Safe → does not change server state

GET

HEAD

OPTIONS

TRACE


Unsafe → modifies data

POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE




---

✅ 7. Explain GET vs HEAD.

GET → returns headers + body
HEAD → returns headers only (no body)

Used to check:

file size

last modified

content type



---

✅ 8. What is OPTIONS method?

Answer:
OPTIONS is used to list what methods are allowed on a resource.

Response example:

Allow: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Also used by browsers for CORS pre-flight.


---

✅ 9. What is TRACE? Why is it disabled?

Answer:
TRACE echoes back the request received by the server → used for debugging.
It is disabled in most servers because it can be used for cross-site tracing attacks.


---

✅ 10. What is CONNECT method?

Answer:
CONNECT is used to establish a tunnel, mainly for HTTPS through a proxy.

Example:

CONNECT www.google.com:443


---

✅ 11. What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?

PUT → full update (replace entire object)
PATCH → partial update (modify specific fields)

If the client sends:

{ "name": "John" }

PUT → other fields become null/empty

PATCH → only name is updated



---

✅ 12. Is DELETE idempotent?

Answer:
Yes, because deleting the same resource again has no further effect.


---

✅ 13. What is RESTful mapping of HTTP methods?

Collection URL (/users)

GET → list users

POST → create user


Single resource (/users/10)

GET → get user

PUT → replace user

PATCH → modify user

DELETE → remove user
